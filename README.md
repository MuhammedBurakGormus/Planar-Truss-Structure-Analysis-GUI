# PlanarTrussStructureAnalysisGUI

The MATLAB GUI allows the analysis of planar truss structures using Finite Element Method such that:

  • The deflection values throughout the structure in both x and y directions
  
  • The stress value for each element
  
  • Reaction forces at the supports can found.
  
The GUI is named as PlanarTrussStructureAnalysisGUI.p; and the other files are needed for running the GUI. 

The manual is named as Truss_Structure_Analysis_Manual.pdf in which the basic instructions related to GUI are given. 

A sample screenshot from the GUI is as follows:<img width="1440" alt="1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77242876/135863665-9a9fdc73-bb1a-4f1d-8a13-56fd83bbb95d.png">
