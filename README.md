# PlanarTrussStructureAnalysisGUI

The MATLAB GUI allows the analysis of planar truss structures using Finite Element Method such that:

  • The deflection values throughout the structure in both x and y directions
  
  • The stress value for each element
  
  • Reaction forces at the supports can found.
  
The GUI is named as TrussStructure_exported.p; and the other files are needed for running the GUI. 

The manual is named as Truss_Structure_Analysis_Manual.pdf in which the basic instructions related to GUI are given. 

The explanatory videos links for the concept&GUI as follows:
